/* Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. */

/* 
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums. 
*/

/* 
Solution:
1. To do this our approach is to first perform the sum of the first n natural numbers and substract that from the sum of the vector elements;
2. Sort the vector fist and then perform a binary search by looping over the range of numbers.

public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int sum = accumulate(nums.begin(),nums.end(), 0);         // sum function to find sum of stt the numbers in the vector
